# Set up the project

## React (using CRA)
If you are using Create-React-App (CRA) to set up your project, the configuration process will be different.

CRA takes care of all the build and configuration process for you, so you don't need to write a batch script or a webpack configuration file.

Here is an example of how you can set up your project using CRA:

```
npx create-react-app client
cd client
npm start
```

This will set up a new React project in a directory called "client" and it will also install all the necessary dependencies. The last command will start the development server and it will open the application in the browser.

You can now proceed to implement the websocket functionality in the client side code.

When you are ready to deploy your application, you can use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

It will create a production-ready build of your application in the build directory, which you can then serve using any web server.
